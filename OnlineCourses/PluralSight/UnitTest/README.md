What is catch ?
---------------
    Catch stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in Headers and is a multi-paradigm automated test framework for C++ and Objective-C (and, maybe, C).
    It is implemented entirely in a set of header files, but is packaged up as a single header for extra convenience.

- Single header deployment
- No external dependencies
- Tests names are free-form strings
- Powerful "Assertions"
- Excellent error mesages
- Sections
