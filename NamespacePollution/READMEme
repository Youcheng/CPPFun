Don't write namespace using declarations or using
directives in a header file, or before an #include directive
in an implementation file.

You are liable to affect the meaning of later code
by causing namespace pollution, by taking an incomplete
snapshot of the names that you want to import, or both.

(Note the qualifier "namespace using
declarations or using directives." This doesn't apply to
writing class member using declarations to bring in base
class member names as needed.)
